# RP2040-PCB-design
Designed and fabricated a custom PCB featuring the RP2040 microcontroller using KiCad, including full schematic capture, trace routing, and PCB layout. Completed hardware bring-up by soldering passives and programming the board with a minimal Ubuntu-based BIOS to initialize the system and enable coding environment support for stepper motors.
